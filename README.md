# SourceSC 4th Metrics API
This is an API for the metrics section of the SourceSC proyect, metrics are used to evaluate the intertns that are on the intership, this API contains the following methods, **POST, PUT, GET , DELETE**, and uses Query's for Mongo DB.
# Getting started
First we need to clone the project form the release branch withc has the current version of the API, keep in mind that this is just one part of the SourceSc project, this being the Metrics API that is used to evaluate interns during their intership.
